# Flappy Gopher

#### Flappy Gopher is a clone of the game Flappy Bird written in `Go`.

The program is almost fully following [Francesc Campoy's](https://twitter.com/campoy) tutorial and walkthrough from [Just For Func](https://youtube.com/justforfunc) episodes [#6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYkxFbd6luY), [7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYkxFbd6luY) and [8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYkxFbd6luY) where Francesc walks you through creating and implementing the game using SDL library.

The final result is a fully functional game with mechanics like that of Flappy Bird.
